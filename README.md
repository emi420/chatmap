# WhatsApp Location Parser

This very simple web app can read locations shared on a WhatsApp chat exported to .txt
and parse them as GeoJSON for displaying them on a map and also download as a file.

It was developed to help emergency services and humanitarian organizations to get
locations from people in the field during disasters and emergencies.

## Run

`npm install`
`npm start`

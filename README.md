# WhatsApp Location Parser

This very simple script can read locations shared on a WhatsApp chat exported to .txt
and print them as a CSV, with values separated by the ';' character.

It was developed to help emergency services and humanitarian organizations to get
locations from people in the field during disasters and emergencies.

`Usage: python wlp.py --file your_whatsapp_exported_chat.txt > your_csv_file.csv`

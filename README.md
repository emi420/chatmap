# ChatMap

Export a chat from the app (WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal) and visualize the locations shared in the conversation.

It was developed to help emergency services and humanitarian organizations to get
locations from people in the field during disasters and emergencies, but it can
be used for anything else.
